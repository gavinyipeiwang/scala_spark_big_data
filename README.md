## Transformations vs Actions
1. Transformations are lazy.
2. Actions are eager. So cache/persist results if necessary.
3. Partition is the smallest computing unit.
4. Following the concept of parallelism in the last course, parallelization in Spark is done on partition level.
5. Run an action job is blocking.
```scala
def submitJob[T, U](
      rdd: RDD[T],
      func: (TaskContext, Iterator[T]) => U,
      partitions: Seq[Int],
      callSite: CallSite,
      resultHandler: (Int, U) => Unit,
      properties: Properties): JobWaiter[U] = {
    // Check to make sure we are not launching a task on a partition that does not exist.
    val maxPartitions = rdd.partitions.length
    partitions.find(p => p >= maxPartitions || p < 0).foreach { p =>
      throw new IllegalArgumentException(
        "Attempting to access a non-existent partition: " + p + ". " +
          "Total number of partitions: " + maxPartitions)
    }

    val jobId = nextJobId.getAndIncrement()
    if (partitions.size == 0) {
      // Return immediately if the job is running 0 tasks
      return new JobWaiter[U](this, jobId, 0, resultHandler)
    }

    assert(partitions.size > 0)
    val func2 = func.asInstanceOf[(TaskContext, Iterator[_]) => _]
    val waiter = new JobWaiter(this, jobId, partitions.size, resultHandler)
    eventProcessLoop.post(JobSubmitted(
      jobId, rdd, func2, partitions.toArray, callSite, waiter,
      SerializationUtils.clone(properties)))
    waiter
}
```
6. Trying to reduce network IO by optimizaing with partitioners for data locality.
